# Emmet commands and keybindings
According to [Emmet documentation] Emmet has three base features:

1. abbreviation expanding
2. Emmet actions - text processing commands
3. Emmet snippets 

Emmet actions may be very useful. For example:

- [remove element](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/remove-tag/)
- [select element content or whole element](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/match-pair/)
- [iterate by edit points after the abbreviation is expanded](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/go-to-edit-point/)
- [select a tag name and attributes to edit](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/select-item/)
- [wrap some html-code with abbreviation](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/wrap-with-abbreviation/#wrap-with-abbreviation)
- [wrap with abbreviation every line individually](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/wrap-with-abbreviation/#wrapping-individual-lines)
- rename element
- and some other

But you need some way to use Emmet actions. This extension suggest you a special menu, where you may see all Emmet commands, which existed in VS Code, and all assigned keybindings.

## In this extension:
- Added menu of the editor title with all Emmet commands. 
- Already existing in VS Code command titles changed to be more understandable 
- Added some keybindings. You may see the keybindings if you open the menu.
- You may add your own keybindings and may see it in menu.

## Notes:
- Not all commands existing in the [Emmet documentation] has implemented in VS Code.
- Assigned keybindings does not correspond to the keybindings of [Emmet documentation].
