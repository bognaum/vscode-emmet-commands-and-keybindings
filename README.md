# Emmet commands and keybindings
According to [Emmet documentation](https://docs.emmet.io/) Emmet has three base features:

1. abbreviation expanding
2. Emmet actions - text processing commands
3. Emmet snippets 

## Emmet actions
Emmet actions may be very useful. For example:

- [remove element](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/remove-tag/)
- [select element content or whole element](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/match-pair/)
- [iterate by edit points after the abbreviation is expanded](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/go-to-edit-point/)
- [select a tag name and attributes to edit](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/select-item/)
- [wrap some html-code with abbreviation](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/wrap-with-abbreviation/#wrap-with-abbreviation)
- [wrap with abbreviation every line individually](https://docs.emmet.io/actions/wrap-with-abbreviation/#wrapping-individual-lines)
- rename element
- and some other

But you need some way to use Emmet actions, and this extension will help you. This extension offers you a special menu in which you can see all Emmet commands that existed in VS Code and all the assigned keybindings.

## In this extension:
- Creates a submenu of the editor title menu with all existing in VS Code Emmet commands. 
- Added a keybinding system for the most used commands. You may see the keybindings if you open the above submenu.
- The titles of existing in VS Code command have changed to more understandable.
- If you will add your own keybindings - you will see your keybindings in the above submenu.

## Notes:
- Not all commands existing in the [Emmet documentation](https://docs.emmet.io/) have implemented in VS Code.
- Assigned keybindings does not correspond to the keybindings of [Emmet documentation](https://docs.emmet.io/).
