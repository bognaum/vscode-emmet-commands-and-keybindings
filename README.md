# Emmet commands and keybindings
Emmet has three base abilities:

1. abbreviations expanding
2. Emmet text processing commands
3. Emmet snippets

The text processing commands may be very useful, but to use the commands, you need some way to run this commands. 

## In this extension:
- Added a special menu of the editor title with all Emmet commands. 
- Added keybindings, which you may use. If you open the menu - you may see this keybindings.
- You may add your own keybindings and see it in this menu.
